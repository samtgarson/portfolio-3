      <h3>Hey there</h3>
      <p>üëã Sam here. I'm a product focused tech lead in London, currently helping <a href="https://sohohouse.com">Soho House</a> build digital products and a culture and model to support them.</p>
      <p>I'm learning about digital products, the teams that build them and how they change our society; and in particular how to create an environment in which effective and considered digital work can be done.</p>
      <p>I've been lucky enough to experience product development at all levels‚Äîfrom strategy, transformation and innovation, through user experience and architecture down to pixels and code.</p>
      <p>I'm not looking for work right now but I'm always eager to have conversations (often arguments) about these subjects and others, preferably over coffee or whiskey‚Äîmy <a href="#">inbox is open</a> ‚úåÔ∏è</p>
